The Lorenz Attractor is the most famous strange Attractor. Discovered in 1963 by [Edward Lorenz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz), this shape has become the signature image of the [Butterfly Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect).

This particular implementation written in P5JS.

What is special about my interactive implementation of the Lorenz Attractor, is that you can easily control the Time-Delta via a Slider.
You can increase and decrease *dx* by simply moving the slider, which will result in different "butterfly"-shapes as a result.
